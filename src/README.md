# Adverts.ie Free Stuff Monitor ðŸŽ¸

This is a Selenium-Java-Maven automated testing project that monitors the "Free Stuff" section on [Adverts.ie](https://www.adverts.ie/), specifically the "Music Instruments & Equipment" subcategory.

The project checks every 5 minutes for newly posted items.  
When a new item appears, it automatically requests it and verifies the request by checking the comment section.
